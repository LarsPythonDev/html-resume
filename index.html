    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a 23 years old man from the Netherlands, currently working as a
      Primary School Teacher with a lot of passion. But, computers have always
      been some kind of passion of mine. Because of this, I've decided to take
      on this new journey from 2024 on. Signed up for the AppBrewery udemy
      course, I'm now on a daily practice of my programming skills, looking
      forward to develop both myself as well as new apps & websites.
